#Research Paper Summarizer using FAISS + Sentence Transformers + T5

This project summarizes any research paper by combining vector search (FAISS) with AI summarization (T5). It follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.

🚀 Features

Chunks large text into manageable segments

Creates vector embeddings (Sentence Transformers)

Stores vectors in FAISS index

Retrieves most relevant text

Produces a high-quality summary using T5
